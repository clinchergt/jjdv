I currently work as a Data Scientist and ML Engineer, have a passion for languages, linguistics and, of course, am an NLP enthusiast.

I studied Software Engineering at Universidad Galileo in Guatemala City from 2010 to 2013. While I was a student I worked as a full-stack web developer and a webmaster. Additionally, I also learned German during that time, which made me discover my love for linguistics and languages. This got me very interested in NLP and that consequently made me get into Deep Learning, as I didn't have any formal training in linguistics.

After finishing school, I worked as a Data Scientist at a software provider for financial institutions for a few years. Additionally, I've finished a specialization from [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noreferrer"} on Coursera and work currently as a Data Scientist at a company in the advertising and healthcare industry.

My hobbies include playing the guitar, helping others with the GRE, and language learning.
