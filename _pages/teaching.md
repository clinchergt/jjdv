### CNN and Medical Images Workshop

The notebook can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GeKc5VsP_tmj5ZwyL6e-2TmrzdPpQXBI?usp=sharing). We used CNNs to try and predict conditions based on medical images.

`fastai` was used in this workshop as it was intended for complete beginners. The notebook even contains a very short and sweet introduction to `python`.
