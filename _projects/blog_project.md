Created my own blog using `jekyll` and hosting it on GH Pages. At the time of writing, most of the interesting content on the JBlog addresses the graduate admissions process, though there are some gems included there on things I've discovered on my way to becoming a decent software engineer and data scientist.

Finding a template proved to be annoying so I might just have to create me own. I have marginally modified the current template being used, but it still doesn't feel quite right. Definitely something to improve upon.

The blog can be found under at this URL: **[https://codewrites.me](https://codewrites.me)**.

I used `jekyll`, `gh-pages`, `ruby`, and `HTML` for this project.
